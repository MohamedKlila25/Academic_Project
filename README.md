# Minesweeper Game in C with SDL3

**Academic Project** – This Minesweeper game was developed as a **team project** by two classmates using **C programming** and the **SDL3 library** for the graphical interface.

## Project Overview

The project consists of a fully functional Minesweeper game featuring:

- Interactive **graphical interface** using SDL3  
- Classic Minesweeper mechanics: reveal tiles, flag mines, win/lose conditions  
- Adjustable **grid size** and **difficulty levels** (optional enhancement)  
- Efficient handling of **game logic** using arrays and structures in C  

## Learning Outcomes & Benefits

- **Teamwork**: collaborated closely with a classmate to design and implement the project  
- **Idea exchange**: shared creative solutions for game logic and GUI implementation  
- **Practical experience**: applied programming concepts such as arrays, loops, functions, and structures in a real project  
- **GUI development**: learned how to use SDL3 to create interactive graphics  

## Technologies Used

- **C Programming Language**  
- **SDL3 Library** for graphics  
- Standard C libraries (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, etc.)  

## How to Run

1. Install **SDL3** on your system.  
2. Compile the project using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`) with SDL3 flags:  
   ```bash
   gcc -o minesweeper main.c -lSDL3
